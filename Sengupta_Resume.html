            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">In my freshman year, the engineering academy exposed me to several opportunities and influential talks. One talk that had a lasting impact on me, was from Aileen Iniguez. She is a data scientist and analytics analyst from Chevron. At Chevron, she uses Python to go through data and clean it to receive accurate, collected data. One major takeaway I gathered from her speech, is that data science is more than working with numbers. In data science, you analyze and interpret data and gather insight. She discovered her interest in data science after college through Techbridge Girls and Project Lead The Way which was a part of her inspirational pathway.

            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">
              Another guest speaker was John Stewart, the Chief Security and Trust Officer of Cisco. In his interactive talk, he focused on his career in security and the challenges he’s faced in cybersecurity. His pathway was inspirational as well, as he has been working in IT for over two decades and has worked at Cisco twice. Stewart is close with and cares for the people that work for him, which is his favorite part of his position at Cisco.

            <p style="color: gray; text-indent: 5%;"><strong>2020-2021 (SOPHOMORE YEAR)</strong></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">During my time in the engineering program, I have met various industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest speakers. Through Zoom on February 4th, I joined a webinar with Kenny Lau, a junior at CalPoly SLO. He received $10,000 in seed funding for co-founding Nova, a financial service that uses blockchain technology to make payments across the globe. He talked about his experiences at Dublin High School, including the Engineering Pathway. When he began college, he focused on computer science rather than engineering.

            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">
              One significant takeaway I grasped from this session is Dublin High School, and the academy offers countless opportunities to discover several engineering disciplines. Similar to Kenny, I intend to study computer science in college and as my career pathway. He emphasizes the importance to explore different opportunities and aspects of the field to gain exposure.

              On October 7th, I attended a webinar organized by Junior Achievement. It was a virtual job shadow at Oracle, a multinational computer technology company. I discovered that Oracle specializes in database software for cloud systems. Additionally, I noticed how enormous the company is, as there were employees internationally from the United States to India. It is evident that Oracle values philanthropy among their employees. Workers are encouraged to volunteer and perform charitable contributions, matched by the Oracle Corporation.

            At the end of 2019, I had a winter internship with Tata Trust, which is India's largest philanthropic organization. I was interning for a health official in the India Health Fund. I wrote a research paper on “Diseases Impacting The Elderly in India.” As a result, I found that falls was one of the main causes of mortality among the elderly. With my knowledge gathered from this experience, I have been developing a wearable prototype for falls among the elderly.

          <p style="text-indent: 4%;">
            I have been volunteering for East Bay Sanctuary Covenant since summer 2019. I have volunteered my time to perform many tasks. I have volunteered at citizenship classes to learn the process of the preparation for the citizenship test to help others pass this exam. I have volunteered at fundraisers and annual dinners for this organization as well as write thank you letters among other paperwork. I have hosted fundraisers as well, as on November 1, 2019, I raised over $500 for this non-profit.
