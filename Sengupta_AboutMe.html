            <h4>Anya Sengupta</h4>
            <br>
            <p> Hello, I am Anya Sengupta, a freshman at Dublin High School. I will work in Information Technology as I am interested in Computer Science and many aspects of the industry. I hope to expand my skills to help deal with bigger issues in society with a Minor relating to human rights and a Major relating to computer science. My goal is to attend a top university. In order to accomplish these goals, I will work on these skills outside of school and take advantage of all the opportunities provided by the Engineering Academy. 
              <br><br>
            Some traits and characteristics that I possess include self-motivation and leadership. When I graduated from middle school, I was one of five students that received the Academic Excellence Award for maintaining a 4.0 GPA throughout my three years of middle school. In my first semester of ninth grade, I received a 4.0 as well. I was able to obtain this with my relentless and persistent mindset, which pushed myself to do better academically. This made me efficient as on top of my grades, I was able to balance my extracurricular activities such as leadership and basketball. 
              <br><br>
            From being the only freshmen on the Junior Varsity Basketball team, I have learned to work well with others and responsibility. While playing a team sport, you learn the importance of having others depend on you. Not only is this important to sports, also in the Technology Industry, as you have meetings and need to collaborate with others. I have also built my leadership skills as last year I participated in leadership, helping organize many school events with people I never knew before. 
              <br><br>
            During the shelter-in-place, I have been working on my skills outside of school as I started an online course on Artificial Intelligence. I have also been gardening during this time and I hope to add sensors in the garden beds in the near future. These sensors will collect data such as pH level, so my garden beds will be efficient and semi-automated. As you can see, I have many characteristics that will be a significant addition to anyone, but my most valuable trait is my passion to continuously learn. I know in this industry, you are always learning on the job, but that may be the best part for me in the future. I am so excited for all the opportunities in the future!
