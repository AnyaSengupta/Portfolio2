            <h4>Anya Sengupta</h4>
            <br>
            <p> Hello, I am Anya Sengupta, a sophomore at Dublin High School. I will work in Information Technology as I am interested in Computer Science and many aspects of the industry. I hope to expand my skills to help deal with larger issues in society with a Minor relating to human rights and a Major relating to computer science. My goal is to attend a top university. To achieve these goals, I will work on these skills outside of school and I will take advantage of all the opportunities provided by the Engineering Academy.
              <br><br>
            Some traits and characteristics that I possess include self-motivation and leadership. When I graduated from middle school, I was one of five students that received the Academic Excellence Award for maintaining a 4.0 GPA throughout my three years of middle school. In my freshman year, I received a 4.16 GPA as well. Through my relentless and persistent mindset, I was able to obtain a 4.60 GPA in my first semester of sophomore year. This made me efficient on and top of my grades, as I can balance academics with my extracurricular activities such as clubs and basketball. 
              <br><br>
            From being the only freshman on the Junior Varsity Basketball team last year, I learned how to work effectively with others and responsibility. Through basketball and receiving the Most Valuable Player award, I learned the importance of having others depend on me. Not only is this essential in sports but also in the Technology Industry when you have meetings and collaborate with others. I persistently work on my leadership skills as I am an officer for the Environmental Technology Club and Build Club.
              <br><br>
            As you can see, I possess various characteristics that will be a significant addition to anyone, but my most valuable trait is my passion to continuously learn. I know in this industry, you are always learning on the job, but that may be the greatest part for me in the future. I am so excited for all the opportunities in the future!
