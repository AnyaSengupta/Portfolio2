            <h4>Anya Sengupta</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Hello, I am Anya Sengupta, a senior at Dublin High School. I plan to work in Information Technology as I am interested in Computer Science and many aspects of the industry. I hope to expand my skills to help deal with larger issues in society with a Minor relating to environmental science and a Major relating to computer science. Through my knowledge of software programming, I hope to be able to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, including food insecurity, human rights, healthcare, and preserving biodiversity. I believe that computer science has a big role to play in creating a more equitable and sustainable world. To achieve these goals, I work on these skills outside of school and I take advantage of all the opportunities provided by the Engineering Academy.
              <br><br>
            Some traits and characteristics that I possess include responsibility and leadership. As team captain of the Girls Varsity Basketball team, I work closely with the new varsity players to ensure they understand our strategies and game plans. I serve as a mentor to some of the younger players, encouraging them to work hard and stay positive as they adjust to the demands of high school basketball and their academic workload. Through the last two years of varsity and receiving the Most Valuable Player award, I learned the importance of having others depend on me. Not only is this essential in sports but also in the Technology Industry when you have meetings and collaborate with others. I persistently work on my leadership skills as I am the President of the Environmental Technology & Sustainability Club.
              <br><br>
           Although I possess various qualities that will be an asset to anyone, I believe that my most valuable trait is my passion for learning. In this industry, you are always learning on the job, but I believe that may be the most rewarding aspect for me in the future. Through this portfolio, you can learn how the Engineering Academy has helped me further my curiosity and develop my programming skills both inside and outside of the classroom.
