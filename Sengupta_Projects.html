            <h3>Jurassic Panic</h3>
            <h4>September 2019, AP Computer Science Principles</h4>
            <p> The objective of this project was to create a game or story with user interaction and multiple stages in Scratch. My partner and I previously used Scratch, so we decided to challenge ourselves by implementing the video camera feature. The objective of our game was for the user to guide the dinosaur into eating a number of sprites under a time limit. We incorporated the video sensibility by the user moving their body to move the sprites into the mouth of the dinosaur. The game has multiple stages, making the game harder as it goes on by decreasing the time limit and later adding obstacles. As the game progresses, pterodactyls will attempt to stop the user and the game. If the user's body touches the pterodactyl, the game will be over. This was my first group project in high school, as I learned the importance of cooperation and teamwork with my partner in this project. I was in charge of the script and programming while she was in working on the documentation so we needed to cooperate with each other.

            <h3>Jailbreak</h3>
            <h4>January 2020, AP Computer Science Principles</h4>
            <p> 
              The objective of this project was to create an adventure game with a consistent theme and user input that affects the story line in Python. We had to face an obstacle as one of the requirements was no loops which meant we needed to use functions. Our objective was to create a jail-theme where the user must find the key to leave the cell by answering riddles. My partner and I delegated the work by splitting up the branches. I focused on the two of the pathways and my partner did the other two. From the assignments prior to the project, My partner and I developed a very effective and productive relationship.

            <h3>Santa Catchinator</h3>
            <h4>November - December 2020, Principles Of Engineering</h4>
            <p> 
              The objective of this project was to design, model, and test an interlocking compound machine that completes the task of capturing “Santa” successfully. The main obstacle we faced in this project was finding materials to use because we could only integrate household items. Each member in my group had to create a part of the Rube Goldberg machine incorporating at least three simple machines like levers, screws, wheel and axle, and pulleys. To demonstrate how our sections would work together, we created a two-dimensional simulation. My group met the requirements and exceeded the expectations even though we faced multiple obstacles.

            <h3>The Recycled Cooling Mat</h3>
            <h4>February - March 2021, Principles Of Engineering</h4>
            <p> 
              The objective of this project was to create a marketable product using recycled materials. We designed a high-quality sleeping/cooling mat made entirely from plastic grocery bags. Our product addresses two prevalent issues in America, decreasing the plastic pollution as well as helping the homeless because we plan on becoming a nonprofit inorder to donate our mats to the less fortunate in the Bay Area. To evaluate our prototype, we conducted a compression and throw test to determine the sturdiness of the mat. In conclusion, our proof of concept achieved the end goal as our prototype definitively provided a functional framework for providing homeless people with durable and comfortable sleeping mats.

            <h3>Space Invasion Deluxe</h3>
            <h4>June - July 2021, AP Computer Science A</h4>
            <p> 
              The objective of this project was to modify an existing Greenfoot Project in an significant way to learn the concepts of different types of loops, lists, and arraylists in Java. The original Space Invasion game consisted of aliens that move towards the spaceship and the spaceship (user) attacks the aliens using keys. We modified this game by adding a high score using an array and sorting this array. We also implemented a speed powerup that lowers the aliens speed towards the user, if the spaceship catches this boost.

            <h3>Memory Game</h3>
            <h4>February - March 2022, AP Computer Science A</h4>
            <p> 
              The objective of this project was to modify an existing memory game, which was provided in the PLTW curriculum. The original memory game features three sets of different letters, where the user needs to memorize and enter the letter sequence. We modified this game by adding more levels that decreases the time between letters and increases the number of letters and boxes per correct user guess. We also implemented multiple colors to make the game more appealing and friendly to users.
